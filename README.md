## About
VekAmp is intended to be a cross platform music player and library management tool making use of the [BASS audio library](https://www.un4seen.com/bass.html). 

The main motivation for this project is to replace my currently used music player (which is Windows exclusive) with one that can be used across several platforms, so that I can get what I'm looking for out of a music player on any platform I may use. I also intend to add a plethora of powerful library management systems to make sure your library is organised and stored in the way you want it to.
